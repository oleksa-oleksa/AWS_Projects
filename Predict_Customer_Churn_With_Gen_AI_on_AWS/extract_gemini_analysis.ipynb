The client shows declining opportunity interest and has had a recent high-priority case, indicating potential dissatisfaction. | **Status:** Inactive, which is a major red flag.  <br> **Account Age:** Long account age (1614 days) but inactivity suggests disengagement. <br> **Opportunity Trend:** Only 1 out of 5 opportunities were Closed Won, with 3 still open and 1 Lost. Low closed-won ratio indicates problems in converting potential to sales.<br> **Average Opportunity Amount:** A fair average opportunity amount ($312,133.4) but this is diminished by low conversion.<br>**Last Opportunity Close Date**: Is in the future (2025-11-19), the data might be off. <br> **Cases:** The negative average case age is not possible. Assuming it indicates some issues in timely support., the presence of a recent high-priority case indicates recent significant problems. Closed cases are much less than open cases.<br> **Communication:** Low communication volume (5 total) with the last communication being relatively recent (2025-07-09). The low and future date indicates little to no engagement.<br>**Overall:** The combination of inactivity, low opportunity conversion, and recent high-priority issues strongly point to a high churn risk.

The negative average case age should prompt a data integrity check, but even considering a very short positive age, the situation remains concerning. The fact that all cases are open suggests the client is experiencing significant difficulties and has not received satisfactory solutions. While there's still one open opportunity, the pending overall status and the dominance of unresolved issues put this client at high risk of churn.
